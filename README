Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

The following is required to build the linux kernel package.

1. Extract linux kernel source
# tar xvjpf linux-source-5.4.0.tar.bz2

2. Copy the config file to .config

3. Disable the following kernel parameters
# ./scripts/config --set-str SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS "" --set-str SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS ""

4. Run "make deb-pkg"
# make deb-pkg LOCALVERSION=-arrcus
